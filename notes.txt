Getting Started
create html, css, js files and link
Make sure customers array is available on main.js - console.log it (lets you know it's connected)
hard code 1 customer in html so that you know what you are asking JS to build
get js to create elements to show each customers name to show on page
move or comment out hard code
get JS to a build a container for each customer
put the name in the container for each customer - do some minimal css to lay out containers
put the email address inside each container with js - emails are unique
put the image via js
put the street address - figure out how to get state abbreviations from state names w/ JS
put the address in the container
figure out how to format dates - DOB and member since
put dates in container
also need to figure out name formatting (because all lowercased - modify innerText (title cased?) )
